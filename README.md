# Welcome to the Neon programming Language Test

welcome to my test language, this is a learning purposes only, use at your own risk

## Examples

  You can find some examples in /examples/
  Here you will find some examples about the neon lang concept

## Source

  The source code is currently written in Kotlin, but this can change later according to the needs of the language.
  You can find my source code in the /src/ folder

### Why kotlin

  Currently speed is not an issue. since it's a concept and learning experience.
  So we went for an easier language to pull of our concepts instead of trying to use a more difficult language with extra learning involved.

### Running the code

  You'll currently need to use a kotlin compiler, then you can make changes in the main.kt file
